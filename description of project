The goal of the summer project in Pr. Danilo Bzdok’s lab was to examine the utilities of Nilearn with Python, specifically with regard to functional connectivity methods. The goal was to predict age from fMRI data of a group of subjects, starting from various forms of the functional connectivity matrices, and to map the linear regression coefficients back to the brain. Different forms of matrices were utilized, including Pearson’s correlation matrices, sparse inverse covariance matrices, and connectivity using the LedoitWolf estimator. These matrices were created from the functional connectivity between 39 regions of the brain according to the MSDL atlas. Next, the matrices were linearized and defined as the x variable, with the y variable being the age of each subject. These matrices were passed through a pipeline- z-score scaling, principal component analysis, and linear regression. The current results yielded a very low r2 value, thus major changes would need to be made to the pipeline. Additionally, the mapping to the brain was unsuccessful, so this would be the next major step.
